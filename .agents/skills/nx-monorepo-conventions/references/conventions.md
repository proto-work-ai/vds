# Proto.ai Nx Monorepo Conventions

Do not invent future apps unless requested. A reserved README is acceptable.

## Angular and NestJS

Use Angular for Admin, Studio, and Landing. Use NestJS for backend applications. Prefer standalone Angular components and `ApplicationConfig` providers.

## Angular localize

All Angular applications (Admin, Studio, and Landing) must be created with `@angular/localize` support enabled.

- Keep `@angular/localize` aligned with the workspace Angular version.
- Add `@angular/localize/init` to the application build `polyfills` when runtime `$localize` support is required.
- Add `"@angular/localize"` to the application's TypeScript `types`.
- Define an `i18n.sourceLocale` in the Nx project configuration. The current source locale is `en-US` until product localization requirements change.
- Add an `extract-i18n` target using `@angular/build:extract-i18n` so messages can be extracted consistently.
- Do not enable multi-locale production builds until actual translation files/locales have been defined.

## TypeScript access modifiers

Use explicit access modifiers and the narrowest useful visibility for class members.

- Use `private` for implementation details, injected dependencies, helpers, and state that is only used inside the class.
- Use `protected` for Angular component members and methods that are consumed by the component template but are not part of the component's external API.
- Use `public` for intentional external APIs such as service methods, controller handlers, and members that other classes are expected to consume.
- Prefer `readonly` for injected dependencies, signals, computed values, column definitions, configuration objects, and any field that should not be reassigned.
- Do not make Angular template bindings `private` because templates must be able to access them.
- NestJS constructor dependencies should normally be `private readonly` unless they intentionally form part of a subclass API.

Example:

```ts
export class ExampleComponent {
  private readonly http = inject(HttpClient);

  protected readonly loading = signal(false);
  protected query = '';

  protected submit(): void {
    this.load();
  }

  private load(): void {
    // Internal implementation.
  }
}
```

## Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind once at workspace root. Use one shared stylesheet such as `styles/tailwind.css` and one root PostCSS config. Include sources for Admin, Studio, Landing, and shared libs. Do not make portable Theme/Block Engine output depend on Tailwind classes.

## Taiga UI

Install compatible Taiga UI packages at root. Use Taiga UI for reusable application controls. Do not make generated user blocks depend on Taiga UI.

## Tables

All data tables use Taiga UI `@taiga-ui/addon-table`. AG Grid Enterprise and the
`libs/ui/ag-grid` library were removed on 2026-08-23; do not reintroduce them without an
explicit decision from the maintainer.

## Prettier

Use one root Prettier config. Mandatory rule: every created or modified `.ts` file must be formatted before completion. For repository-wide TypeScript formatting use:

```bash
pnpm format:ts
pnpm format:ts:check
```

## Angular template rule

Inline `template` is allowed only when normalized content is `<= 100` characters. Anything longer must use a sibling `.component.html` via `templateUrl`. After extraction, format both `.ts` and `.html`.

Run:

```bash
pnpm check:templates
```

## Theme/Block Engine boundary

```text
Angular Admin / Studio
  Tailwind
  Taiga UI

Theme Engine / Block Engine
  Design Tokens
  CSS Variables
  portable schemas
```

Do not leak application UI frameworks into portable rendering contracts.

## Verification

Before completing a repository change:

- confirm dependency compatibility;
- confirm Angular templates >100 chars use `templateUrl`;
- confirm each `templateUrl` exists;
- run Prettier/checks when dependencies are available;
- run affected Nx build/lint/typecheck/runtime checks when available;
- never claim successful execution if it did not run.
